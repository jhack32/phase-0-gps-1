# Questions

## What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I had some trouble previously with fetch and merge but I got it down after the GPS session.

## What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

The git fetch/merge was clarified during GPS along with linking images in the markdown file.

## What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

I asked questions about the usage of fetch/merge. I had an issue with the merge command and my pair had guided me towards solving it.

## What still confuses you about git?

I feel like i have a good understanding of Git as of right now. I don't feel like I've run into any issues so far.

## How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

It was good. When it started, it was a little confusing, but eventually got the hang of it. I feel like it benefited both of us because we got to practice and iterate what we were doing. This helped us with understanding the material more.

### Reflection

In this weeks GPS, we worked on version control/git which was the challenges for week 1. GPS is definitely beneficial to both parties. If one doesn't know the answer, the other can try to help/explain and if not the guide is there to assist. It also helps reinforce the material that was already taught. Looking forward to next week's GPS challenge!
